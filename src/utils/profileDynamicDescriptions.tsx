  Imagination: {
    high: `You scored highly in Imagination.
This means you're naturally drawn to new ideas, creativity, and a wide range of experiences. You thrive in environments that reward curiosity, innovation, and flexibility. Whether it's brainstorming a bold new direction or questioning the status quo, your ability to think outside the box is a real asset.
In decision-making, you're likely to generate original ideas and challenge conventional assumptions. Just be mindful to ground your vision in the practical needs of the moment—especially when working with more structured thinkers.`,

    medium: `You fall in the mid-range for Imagination.
This suggests you're open to new ideas but also value structure and reliability. You're able to explore creative options without losing sight of what's realistic or proven.
In teams, you can often bridge the gap—appreciating innovation while bringing a measured, grounded approach to decisions. You're flexible, adaptive, and likely to weigh novelty alongside feasibility.`,

    low: `You're on the lower end of the scale for Imagination.
This means you tend to prefer proven methods over untested ideas. You likely feel most confident when there's structure, routine, and clear precedent guiding your decisions.
In decision-making, this brings focus, caution, and consistency—valuable in high-risk or complex environments. Just be aware of opportunities that may sit outside familiar territory. Working with more imaginative peers can help surface new options without compromising your sense of certainty.`
  },

  Extraversion: {
    high: `You scored high in Extraversion, which means you likely gain energy from being around people. You're enthusiastic, sociable, and often take the lead in group settings. You're comfortable sharing ideas out loud, thinking on your feet, and keeping momentum in a room.
This style makes you a natural connector. In decision-making, you tend to speak up early, encourage contributions from others, and move toward action with confidence. Your presence helps teams stay motivated and engaged.
The flip side? High extraversion can sometimes drown out quieter voices or skip over deeper reflection. Build in pauses, check that everyone's perspective is heard, and give yourself space to slow down when needed.`,

    medium: `You sit in the mid-range for Extraversion, which suggests you're flexible in how you engage. You can confidently interact in group settings when needed but also value time to think things through on your own.
This balance allows you to adapt to a wide range of situations — leading when necessary, listening when it's more effective. In decision-making, you may prefer to weigh your thoughts before jumping in, but you're capable of drawing out others and building consensus when needed.
It's a versatile style, but in highly social environments, you may need to be deliberate about stepping forward. And in quieter rooms, don't underestimate the value your voice can bring.`,

    low: `You scored lower on Extraversion, which means you're more inward-facing in how you process ideas and make decisions. You likely prefer deep thinking over fast talk, and small-group or one-on-one interactions over large, high-energy settings.
This doesn't mean you can't lead or collaborate — but you probably do it best with preparation and reflection. In decision-making, your strength lies in considering different angles carefully and speaking up when you've formed a clear point of view.
Sometimes, others may misread quietness as disinterest. Be intentional about sharing your insights early, especially in fast-moving discussions. Your calm, thoughtful presence can bring needed depth and clarity to any decision.`
  },

  Agreeableness: {
    high: `You scored highly in Agreeableness, which means you're likely warm, cooperative, and deeply considerate of others. You bring empathy and trust into your relationships and are naturally inclined to maintain harmony. In team settings, you're often the one smoothing tensions, ensuring everyone feels heard, and fostering an inclusive, respectful environment.
While these traits make you a valued collaborator, high agreeableness can sometimes lead to avoiding conflict or compromising too quickly. In high-stakes decision-making, remember that disagreement isn't disloyalty. Balancing empathy with assertiveness can help you stay true to your values while still accommodating others.
You're especially strong at bringing people together, facilitating buy-in, and helping teams find common ground. Just be mindful of when a clear stance — even an unpopular one — is what's most needed.`,

    medium: `You fall in the moderate range for Agreeableness, striking a balance between collaboration and independence. You're generally cooperative and considerate, but you're also comfortable pushing back when needed. This makes you adaptable across a range of decision-making situations — from high-consensus environments to ones where assertiveness is critical.
You likely value harmony but won't sacrifice outcomes just to keep the peace. This balanced approach helps you manage group dynamics while still moving toward action.
In decision-making, you're well placed to act as both connector and challenger — someone who knows when to build consensus, and when to challenge ideas that might be holding the group back.`,

    low: `You scored on the lower end of Agreeableness, which suggests you're more independent, skeptical, and focused on direct outcomes than social cohesion. You're likely comfortable questioning ideas, speaking frankly, and pushing for what you believe is right — even if it creates tension.
This assertiveness can be a real strength in fast-paced or high-stakes decision-making, where clarity and results matter most. You're unlikely to sugarcoat things, and your team can count on you to raise hard truths.
However, being mindful of how others experience your input can help you be just as effective at building alignment as you are at calling things out. Even small steps to acknowledge others' perspectives can strengthen trust and improve the influence of your ideas.`
  },

  Conscientiousness: {
    high: `You scored high in Conscientiousness.
You are organized, responsible, and self-disciplined. You take deadlines seriously and tend to plan ahead, often becoming the go-to person when precision and follow-through are required. People trust you to follow through—because you do.
In decision-making, your strength lies in being methodical. You think before you act, weigh the risks, and ensure that every choice is intentional. This approach helps avoid rash decisions and brings stability to teams. Just watch for over-perfectionism. Sometimes, "good enough" is the best move forward.`,

    medium: `You're moderately conscientious.
You can balance structure and flexibility. When the task demands focus, you can dial into details and get things done. But you also know when to relax the plan and improvise. This blend can make you adaptable and practical in many decision-making environments.
Your decision-making benefits from your ability to weigh details without getting stuck in them. If you find yourself hesitating, it may help to tighten up timelines or accountability structures to keep momentum.`,

    low: `You scored lower in Conscientiousness.
You likely prefer flexibility over strict structure and may resist rigid planning. While this can help you stay agile and think outside the box, it may sometimes make it difficult to follow through or manage long-term goals.
In decisions, you may lean toward quick action and improvisation—useful in dynamic environments, but risky when decisions require careful planning. Building systems for focus and consistency can help ensure great ideas get across the finish line.`

  "Emotional Stability": {
    high: `You scored high in Emotional Stability.
You're calm, steady, and resilient — even when things get tense. Stress doesn't knock you off course easily, and others likely turn to you when situations get challenging. This composure makes you a valuable presence in high-stakes or unpredictable environments.
In decision-making, your clarity under pressure helps keep discussions grounded. You don't overreact or get caught up in drama. Just keep in mind that emotional presence matters too — staying steady is a strength, but tuning into how others feel helps you lead with empathy.`,

    medium: `You show a balanced level of Emotional Stability.
You're generally composed but may feel stress in certain situations — particularly when stakes are high or outcomes are uncertain. This balance helps you relate to both highly stable and more reactive team members.
In decision-making, you can stay focused while still being emotionally aware. You may benefit from stress-management strategies to stay at your best in fast-moving environments. Trust your instincts, and remember: occasional discomfort isn't a weakness — it's often a cue for growth.`,

    low: `You scored lower in Emotional Stability.
You may be more emotionally reactive or sensitive to stress than others. While this can be challenging at times, it can also make you highly perceptive, empathetic, and attuned to group dynamics.
In decisions, you might find uncertainty or conflict overwhelming, leading to hesitation or second-guessing. Building strategies to manage stress — like reframing anxiety or creating decision structure — can help you channel emotional intensity into insight, rather than reactivity. You don't need to feel calm all the time to be a great contributor.`
  },

  Risks: {
    high: `You've scored highly in Risk.
This means you have a natural ability to foresee potential problems and manage uncertainty effectively. You're often the one who anticipates challenges others might miss — and you take proactive steps to mitigate risks before they become issues. Your cautious, thoughtful decision-making is especially valuable in high-stakes environments like crisis response, strategic planning, or innovation-led work.`,

    medium: `You show a balanced approach to managing uncertainty. While you don't default to risk analysis, you're capable of spotting potential issues when needed — especially when stakes are high or others depend on you to be the steady hand. This makes you a valuable team member in dynamic environments, where a measured view of possible downsides can support more grounded decisions.`,

    low: `You don't tend to lead with risk in your decision-making. You may be more focused on possibilities, outcomes, or action — and less likely to slow down to assess what could go wrong. That doesn't mean you ignore risk altogether, but it likely enters your thinking later — or comes from someone else in the room. Teaming up with a strong risk-oriented thinker can help you build more robust, future-proof decisions.`
  },

  People: {
    high: `You've scored highly in People.
This means your natural ability to engage others is one of your biggest strengths. You excel at building strong relationships and fostering a collaborative environment. In team settings, you are the person who ensures everyone's voice is heard, making you the glue that holds the group together. This inclusive approach not only enhances team cohesion but also leads to more thoughtful and well-rounded decisions by incorporating diverse perspectives.`,

    medium: `You bring a thoughtful level of consideration for others into your decision-making. While not always your default mode, you're able to tune into group dynamics when it matters — helping to bring people along, clarify perspectives, or create alignment when needed. This makes you an effective collaborator, especially in cross-functional or diverse teams.`,

    low: `You're not someone who automatically prioritizes the social or interpersonal dynamics of a decision. While you may value input and collaboration, you're unlikely to begin by asking, "Who needs to be involved?" or "How will this affect the group?" That's not a flaw — it just means your attention is probably elsewhere first. Partnering with someone high in the People style can help ensure voices are heard and impacts are considered.`
  },

  Options: {
    high: `You've scored highly in Options.
This means you excel at generating and evaluating multiple alternatives when faced with a decision. Your ability to think creatively and strategically means that you are rarely stuck with a single solution—you often see possibilities where others see limitations. This strength is particularly valuable in innovative roles or environments that require out-of-the-box thinking, such as product development, strategic planning, or creative industries.`,

    medium: `You're able to see multiple paths forward — even if you don't always chase every possibility. This balance allows you to weigh creative solutions when the moment calls for it, without getting stuck in analysis paralysis. You bring versatility to decision-making, switching between conventional and outside-the-box thinking depending on the situation.`,

    low: `You're more likely to seek clarity than generate a range of alternatives. You might prefer choosing from clear paths or getting straight to a solution rather than brainstorming multiple options. That doesn't mean you lack creativity — just that divergent thinking may not be your first move. Collaborating with someone who thrives in this space can help expand the playing field before a decision is made.`
  },

  Process: {
    high: `You've scored highly in Process.
This means your ability to bring structure and consistency to decision-making is one of your greatest strengths. You excel in environments where clear planning, organization, and step-by-step processes are essential. Your methodical approach ensures that decisions are thoughtful, well-documented, and repeatable. This focus on process often leads to high levels of transparency and accountability, making you a valuable asset in roles that require precision and reliability.`,

    medium: `You appreciate the value of structure, even if you don't always start there. You're capable of creating order and clarity when a decision needs it — such as in planning, documentation, or repeatable workflows. This flexibility allows you to operate well in both structured and adaptive environments.`,

    low: `You're unlikely to default to structure or step-by-step planning when making decisions. You might move quickly, follow instinct, or adapt as you go — rather than mapping things out in advance. This can be a strength in fast-moving situations, but it also means that a strong Process thinker in your team can bring valuable clarity, documentation, and repeatability to your decisions.`
  },

  Evidence: {
    high: `You've scored highly in Evidence.
This means you rely heavily on data and factual information when making decisions. You are methodical and analytical, preferring to base your choices on well-supported facts rather than assumptions or intuition. This trait is essential in roles where accuracy and accountability are paramount, such as research, data analysis, or financial management. Your ability to sift through information and identify the most reliable sources ensures that decisions are grounded in reality.`,

    medium: `You lean on evidence and data when the stakes are high or the situation is unfamiliar — but you're not overly dependent on it. You're able to draw from facts to strengthen a case or bring clarity to a group, while also staying open to intuition or experience. This makes you a valuable bridge between analytical and people-centered approaches.`,

    low: `You may not lean heavily on data or empirical proof to guide your decisions. You might prefer experience, intuition, or qualitative input — and see facts as just one piece of the puzzle. That's a valid approach in many environments, but it's useful to balance it with evidence-focused thinkers who can ground your ideas in verifiable information.`
  },

  Outcomes: {
    high: `You've scored highly in Outcomes.
This means you have a natural focus on achieving tangible results. You excel in roles where success is clearly defined and measured, whether that's through hitting sales targets, completing projects on time, or meeting other performance benchmarks. Your ability to visualize the end goal allows you to break down complex tasks into manageable steps, ensuring that nothing is overlooked on the way to success. This outcome-driven mindset makes you a strong asset in environments where precision and goal achievement are paramount.`,

    medium: `You think about results, even if it's not your sole driver. You're often motivated by progress and direction, and you know how to align decisions to broader goals when the time is right. This mindset helps keep momentum going without losing sight of nuance or context.`,

    low: `You don't tend to lead with end results or metrics when making decisions. You may be more focused on the process, people, or exploration itself — rather than the finish line. This can be a powerful strength in values-driven or exploratory work. But when goals and targets matter, partnering with outcome-focused thinkers can help ensure your ideas translate into tangible impact.`
